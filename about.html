        I first studied C in university, however, Pointer ruined my experience
        to the point where I decided not to pursue programming at the time.

        A few years later, while I was working at a power plant, I was assigned
        a C# and SQL project. Without much coding experience, I have completed
        the project perfectly and in the meantime I began enjoying programming.
        Afterwards, I took some C# and SQL online courses and since have passed
        the Microsoft exams to earn my MCP and MCSA certifications.

        I havenâ€™t stopped learning since! I taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        Node.js, and React.js,and even landed an entry-level developer job on my
        own! That said, the more I learned the more I noticed the minor holes in
        my programming knowledge base, so I joined TECHCreers to solidify my
        foundations and enhance my skills!
